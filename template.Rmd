## Trivial problems cost a lot of time


- fixing code style issues.

- rendering `README.Rmd`.

- run `roxygen2::roxygenize()` to generate `.Rd` docs.

- declare missing dependency in `DESCRIPTION`.

- ...

## How to deal with trivial problems


.center[
```{r, out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/meme.jpeg")
```
]

## So what is pre-commit?

- unit tests for your commits, invoked through `$ git commit`.
- Commit is aborted if:
    - if a hook finds a problem.
    - if a hook changes a file.
- CLI program (written in Python)
- supports hooks in many languages

---

## And what is {precommit}?

R package:

* {usethis}-like functionality for setup of pre-commit.

* implementation of R hooks.
  
---


## What can pre-commit do for you?

* Save you time 

* Better commits = better code quality

.center[
```{r, out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/oops.png")
```
]

## Why does pre-commit stand out?

- Focus on your code.

- A declarative configuration file for routine checks.

- Locally and remotely. Or just one of the two.

- Dependency isolation.

- No git history convolution.

- The power of the crowd.

- Extensible.

- Standing on the shoulders of giants.

- Independent.

## Demo

* Set-up precommit.

* Show hooks in action.

* continuous integration.

* Write your own hooks.
